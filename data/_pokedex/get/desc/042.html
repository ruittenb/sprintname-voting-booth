Its sharp fangs puncture the toughest of hides and have small holes for greedily sucking blood.
Flitting around in the dead of night, it sinks its fangs into its prey and drains a nearly fatal amount of blood.
Once it bites, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly.
Once it starts sucking blood, it does not stop until it is full. It flies at night in search of prey.
Golbat loves to drink the blood of living things. It is particularly active in the pitch black of night. This Pokémon flits around in the night skies, seeking fresh blood.
Golbat bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks the victim’s blood. It becomes active on inky dark moonless nights, flying around to attack people and Pokémon.
Sometimes they drink so much blood, they can’t fly anymore. Then they fall to the ground and become food for other Pokémon.
Every once in a while, you’ll see a Golbat that’s missing some fangs. This happens when hunger drives it to try biting a Steel-type Pokémon.
