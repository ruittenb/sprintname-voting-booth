When it wavers its big, round eyes, it begins singing a lullaby that makes everyone drowsy.
Looking into its cute, round eyes makes it start singing a song so pleasant listeners can’t help but fall asleep.
It captivates foes with its huge, round eyes, then lulls them to sleep by singing a soothing melody.
If it inflates to sing a lullaby, it can perform longer and cause sure drowsiness in its audience.
Jigglypuff’s vocal cords can freely adjust the wavelength of its voice. This Pokémon uses this ability to sing at precisely the right wavelength to make its foes most drowsy.
When this Pokémon sings, it never pauses to breathe. If it is in a battle against an opponent that does not easily fall asleep, Jigglypuff cannot breathe, endangering its life.
Jigglypuff possess a vocal range that exceeds 12 octaves, but each individual’s singing skill depends on its own effort.
Recordings of Jigglypuff’s strange lullabies can be purchased from department stores. These CDs can be found near the bedding area.
