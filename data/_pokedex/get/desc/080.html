Though usually dim witted, it seems to become inspired if the Shellder on its tail bites down.
An attached Shellder won’t let go because of the tasty flavor that oozes out of its tail.
When a Slowpoke went hunting in the sea, its tail was bitten by a Shellder. That made it evolve into Slowbro.
Slowbro’s tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore. This causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead.
Whenever Shellder bites down hard on its tail, it gives Slowbro a flash of inspiration...which it forgets a moment later.
Spacing out is basically all it does. It turns back into Slowpoke if its tail, along with Shellder, breaks off.
