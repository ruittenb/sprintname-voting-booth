A Pok√©mon that lives on icebergs. It swims in the sea using the point on its head to break up ice.
The colder it gets, the better it feels. It joyfully swims around oceans so cold that they are filled with floating ice.
Covered with light blue fur, its hide is thick and tough. It is active in bitter cold of -40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Seel hunts for prey in the frigid sea underneath sheets of ice. When it needs to breathe, it punches a hole through the ice with the sharply protruding section of its head.
It has always been supposed that Seel live only in cold seas. Their having shown up in Alola is a mystery.
