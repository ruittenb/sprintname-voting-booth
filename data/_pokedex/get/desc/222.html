Many live in the clean seas of the south. They apparently can’t live in polluted waters.
They prefer unpolluted southern seas. Their coral branches lose their color and deteriorate in dirty water.
It continuously sheds and grows. The tip of its head is prized as a treasure because of its beauty.
Corsola’s branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight. If any branch breaks off, this Pokémon grows it back in just one night.
Clusters of Corsola congregate in warm seas where they serve as ideal hiding places for smaller Pokémon. When the water temperature falls, this Pokémon migrates to the southern seas.
Pursued by Mareanie for the branches on its head, this Pokémon will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion while it escapes.
The pink of Corsola that live in Alola is deep and vibrant, thanks to seas filled with nutrition.
