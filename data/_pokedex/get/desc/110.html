It grows by feeding on gases released by garbage. Though very rare, triplets have been found.
Inhaling toxic fumes from trash and mixing them inside its body lets it spread an even fouler stench.
If one of the twin Koffing inflates, the other one deflates. It constantly mixes its poisonous gases.
Very rarely, a sudden mutation can result in two small Koffing twins becoming conjoined as a Weezing.
Weezing loves the gases given off by rotted kitchen garbage. This Pokémon will find a dirty, unkempt house and make it its home. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash.
Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix together toxic gases inside. The more the gases are mixed, the more powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also becomes more putrid.
