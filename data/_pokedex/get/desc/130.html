Once it begins to rampage, a Gyarados will burn everything down, even in a harsh storm.
In ancient literature, there is a record of a Gyarados that razed a village when violence flared.
Rarely seen in the wild. Huge and vicious, it is capable of destroying entire cities in a rage.
When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon’s wildly violent nature.
Once Gyarados goes on a rampage, its ferociously violent blood doesn’t calm until it has burned everything down. There are records of this Pokémon’s rampages lasting a whole month.
There are people who swear that any place Gyarados appears is fated for destruction.
It fires hyper beams in all directions, burning the surrounding area to ash. There are some regions where it’s called “the deity of destruction.”
