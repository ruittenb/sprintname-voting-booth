When it senses danger, it raises all the barbs on its body. These barbs grow slower than Nidorino’s.
The female has a gentle temperament. It emits ultrasonic cries that have the power to befuddle foes.
When feeding its young, it first chews the food into a paste, then spits it out for the offspring.
When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.
