A Pokémon ancestor that was reanimated from a fossil. It lived in the sea and hunted with claws.
It is a kind of Pokémon progenitor. It uses its extending claws to catch prey hiding among rocks on the seafloor.
Anorith was regenerated from a prehistoric fossil. This primitive Pokémon once lived in warm seas. It grips its prey firmly between its two large claws.
Anorith is said to be a type of Pokémon predecessor, with eight wings at the sides of its body. This Pokémon swam in the primordial sea by undulating these eight wings.
When restored Anorith are released into the ocean, they don’t thrive, because the water composition has changed since their era.
