It loves to match power with big-bodied Pokémon. It can knock a truck flying with its arm thrusts.
It stomps on the ground to build power. It can send a 10-ton truck flying with a straight-arm punch.
Hariyama practices its straight-arm slaps in any number of locations. One hit of this Pokémon’s powerful, openhanded, straight-arm punches could snap a telephone pole in two.
Hariyama’s thick body may appear fat, but it is actually a hunk of solid muscle. If this Pokémon bears down and tightens all its muscles, its body becomes as hard as a rock.
They love to compare their freakish strength— strength enough to send a truck flying with a single slap.
Although they enjoy comparing their strength, they’re also kind. They value etiquette, praising opponents they battle.
