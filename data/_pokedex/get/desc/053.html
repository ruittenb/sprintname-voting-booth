A very haughty Pokémon. Among fans, the size of the jewel in its forehead is a topic of much talk.
Although its fur has many admirers, it is tough to raise as a pet because of its fickle meanness.
Its lithe muscles allow it to walk without making a sound. It attacks in an instant.
Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness. The whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the Pokémon’s surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers.
It has a high opinion of itself, although not to the same extent as the Alolan Persian. It’s quite difficult to make friends with this Pokémon.
Although the jewel on its forehead appears to be a different color than those of Alolan Persian, it’s mostly made of the same material.
