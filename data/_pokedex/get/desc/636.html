This Pok√©mon was believed to have been born from the sun. When it evolves, its entire body is engulfed in flames.
The base of volcanoes is where they make their homes. They shoot fire from their five horns to repel attacking enemies.
Said to have been born from the sun, it spews fire from its horns and encases itself in a cocoon of fire when it evolves.
When battling opponents, it sprays fire from its five horns. The max temperature of the flames can reach nearly 5,500 degrees Fahrenheit.
