When Doduo evolves into this odd breed, one of its heads splits into two. It runs at nearly 40 mph.
An enemy that takes its eyes off any of the three heads--even for a second--will get pecked severely.
An odd species that is rarely found. The three heads respectively represent joy, sadness, and anger.
Watch out if Dodrio’s three heads are looking in three separate directions. It’s a sure sign that it is on its guard. Don’t go near this Pokémon if it’s being wary—it may decide to peck you.
Apparently, the heads aren’t the only parts of the body that Dodrio has three of. It has three sets of hearts and lungs as well, so it is capable of running long distances without rest.
