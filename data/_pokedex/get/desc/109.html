Lighter-than-air gases in its body keep it aloft. The gases not only smell, they are also explosive.
Toxic gas is held within its thin, balloon-shaped body, so it can cause massive explosions.
Its thin, balloon-like body is inflated by horribly toxic gases. It reeks when it is nearby.
If Koffing becomes agitated, it raises the toxicity of its internal gases and jets them out from all over its body. This Pokémon may also overinflate its round body, then explode.
Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas is concocted by this Pokémon.
