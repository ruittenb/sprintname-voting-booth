Though small in stature, it is powerful enough to easily heft and throw a number of Geodude at once.
It hefts a Graveler repeatedly to strengthen its entire body. It uses every type of martial arts.
Its whole body is composed of muscles. Even though it’s the size of a human child, it can hurl 100 grown-ups.
Machop’s muscles are special—they never get sore no matter how much they are used in exercise. This Pokémon has sufficient power to hurl a hundred adult humans.
Machop exercises by hefting around a Graveler as if it were a barbell. There are some Machop that travel the world in a quest to master all kinds of martial arts.
With its superhuman strength, it’s able to throw a hundred people all at the same time. Its strength comes from lifting Graveler every day.
Once this Pokémon has gained enough confidence and muscle from training with its friends, it challenges Makuhita to a battle.
