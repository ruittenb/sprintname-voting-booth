The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn’t dry out.
It’s covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly.
Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing.
It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move.
