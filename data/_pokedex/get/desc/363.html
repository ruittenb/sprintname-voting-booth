It rolls across ice floes to reach shore because its body is poorly shaped for swimming.
They can’t swim well yet, and they move much faster by rolling. When they’re happy, they clap fins.
Its body is covered in fluffy fur. The fur keeps it from feeling cold while it is rolling on ice.
Spheal is much faster rolling than walking to get around. When groups of this Pokémon eat, they all clap at once to show their pleasure. Because of this, their mealtimes are noisy.
Spheal always travels by rolling around on its ball-like body. When the season for ice floes arrives, this Pokémon can be seen rolling about on ice and crossing the sea.
