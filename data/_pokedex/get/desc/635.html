This brutal Pokémon travels the skies on its six wings. Anything that moves seems like a foe to it, triggering its attack.
The heads on their arms do not have brains. They use all three heads to consume and destroy everything.
It responds to movement by attacking. This scary, three-headed Pokémon devours everything in its path!
