Though it appears very elegant when swimming with fins unfurled, it can jab powerfully with its horn.
It swims at a steady 5 knots. If it senses danger, it will strike back with its sharp horn.
Its dorsal, pectoral, and tail fins wave elegantly in water. That is why it is known as the water dancer.
Goldeen is a very beautiful Pokémon with fins that billow elegantly in water. However, don’t let your guard down around this Pokémon—it could ram you powerfully with its horn.
Goldeen loves swimming wild and free in rivers and ponds. If one of these Pokémon is placed in an aquarium, it will shatter even the thickest glass with one ram of its horn and make its escape.
Spellbound by the length of its horn and the beauty of its fins, many strange Trainers raise Goldeen and nothing but Goldeen.
Although known for their splendid tail fins, Goldeen apparently compete among themselves to see whose horn is thickest and sharpest.
