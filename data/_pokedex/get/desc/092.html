Born from gases, anyone would faint if engulfed by its gaseous body, which contains poison.
Its body is made of gas. Despite lacking substance, it can envelop an opponent of any size and cause suffocation.
Gastly is largely composed of gaseous matter. When exposed to a strong wind, the gaseous body quickly dwindles away. Groups of this Pokémon cluster under the eaves of houses to escape the ravages of wind.
Although Gastly is barely visible, when it’s near, a faint sweet smell lingers.
It’s said that gas emanating from a graveyard was possessed by the grievances of the deceased and thus became a Pokémon.
