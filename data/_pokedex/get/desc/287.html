It spends nearly all its time in a day sprawled out. Just seeing it makes one drowsy.
If it eats just three leaves in a day, it is satisfied. Other than that, it sleeps for 20 hours a day.
The way Slakoth lolls around makes anyone who watches it feel like doing the same.
Slakoth lolls around for over 20 hours every day. Because it moves so little, it does not need much food. This Pokémon’s sole daily meal consists of just three leaves.
Slakoth’s heart beats just once a minute. Whatever happens, it is content to loaf around motionless. It is rare to see this Pokémon in motion.
