The male with the largest mane of fire is the leader of the pride.
With fiery breath of more than 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, they viciously threaten any challenger. The females protect the prideâ€™s cubs.
The males are usually lazy, but when attacked by a strong foe, a male will protect its friends with no regard for its own safety.
