It loves to lurk inside holes in rocks. It sometimes sprays ink on prey by sticking out only its mouth.
It has a tendency to want to be in holes. It prefers rock crags or pots and sprays ink from them before attacking.
It traps foes with the suction cups on its tentacles, then smashes them with its rock-hard head.
Octillery grabs onto its foe using its tentacles. This Pokémon tries to immobilize it before delivering the finishing blow. If the foe turns out to be too strong, Octillery spews ink to escape.
The ink it spits when escaping is special. It contains a substance that dulls the sense of smell, so Pokémon with keen noses get lost.
