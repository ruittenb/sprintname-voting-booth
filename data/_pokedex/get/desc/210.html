It is timid in spite of its looks. If it becomes enraged, however, it will strike with its huge fangs.
It can make most any Pokémon run away simply by opening its mouth wide to reveal its big fangs.
Granbull has a particularly well-developed lower jaw. The enormous fangs are heavy, causing the Pokémon to tip its head back for balance. Unless it is startled, it will not try to bite indiscriminately.
More timid than Snubbull, this Pokémon is doted on by young people amused at the contrast between its looks and its attitude.
While it has powerful jaws, it doesn’t care for disputes, so it rarely has a chance to display their might.
