It looks just like a pinecone. Its shell protects it from bird Pokémon that peck it by mistake.
It likes to make its shell thicker by adding layers of tree bark. The additional weight doesn’t bother it.
Pineco hangs from a tree branch and patiently waits for prey to come along. If the Pokémon is disturbed while eating by someone shaking its tree, it drops down to the ground and explodes with no warning.
Motionless, it hangs from trees, waiting for its bug Pokémon prey to come to it. Its favorite in Alola is Cutiefly.
