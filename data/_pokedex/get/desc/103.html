It is called “The Walking Jungle.” If a head grows too big, it falls off and becomes an Exeggcute.
Its three heads think independently. However, they are friendly and never appear to squabble.
Exeggutor originally came from the tropics. Its heads steadily grow larger from exposure to strong sunlight. It is said that when the heads fall off, they group together to form Exeggcute.
When the time comes, one of its three heads falls off. Before long, the fallen head grows into an Exeggcute.
It engages its enemies using psychic powers. Each of its three heads fires off psychokinetic energy, tripling its power.
