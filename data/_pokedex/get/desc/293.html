Usually, its cries are like quiet murmurs. If frightened, it shrieks at the same volume as a jet plane.
It usually murmurs but starts crying loudly if it senses danger. It stops when its ear covers are shut.
If it senses danger, it scares the foe by crying out with the volume of a jet-plane engine.
Normally, Whismur’s voice is very quiet—it is barely audible even if one is paying close attention. However, if this Pokémon senses danger, it starts crying at an earsplitting volume.
Whismur is very timid. If it starts to cry loudly, it becomes startled by its own crying and cries even harder. When it finally stops crying, the Pokémon goes to sleep, all tired out.
