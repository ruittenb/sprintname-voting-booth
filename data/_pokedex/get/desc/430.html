If one utters a deep cry, many Murkrow gather quickly. For this, it is called “Summoner of Night.”
Becoming active at night, it is known to swarm with numerous Murkrow in tow.
If its Murkrow cronies fail to catch food for it, or if it feels they have betrayed it, it will hunt them down wherever they are and punish them.
It will absolutely not forgive failure from or betrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this if it wants to maintain the order of the flock.
