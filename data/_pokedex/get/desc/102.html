Its six eggs converse using telepathy. They can quickly gather if they become separated.
Even though it appears to be eggs of some sort, it was discovered to be a life-form more like plant seeds.
This Pokémon consists of six eggs that form a closely knit cluster. The six eggs attract each other and spin around. When cracks increasingly appear on the eggs, Exeggcute is close to evolution.
Six of them together form a full-fledged Pokémon. It’s often hunted by Crabrawler, but uses psychokinesis to drive it off.
Six of them form a single Pokémon. Should one of the six be lost, the next morning there will once more be six.
