It swallows anything whole. It sweats toxic fluids from its follicles to douse foes.
It gulps anything that fits in its mouth. Its special enzymes can dissolve anything.
When Swalot spots prey, it spurts out a hideously toxic fluid from its pores and sprays the target. Once the prey has weakened, this Pokémon gulps it down whole with its cavernous mouth.
Swalot has no teeth, so what it eats, it swallows whole, no matter what. Its cavernous mouth yawns widely. An automobile tire could easily fit inside this Pokémon’s mouth.
