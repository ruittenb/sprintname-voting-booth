It likes to lurk in the dark and tap shoulders with a gaseous hand. Its touch causes endless shuddering.
If you get the feeling of being watched in darkness when nobody is around, Haunter is there.
It licks with its gaseous tongue to steal the victim’s life force. It lurks in darkness for prey.
Haunter is a dangerous Pokémon. If one beckons you while floating in darkness, you must never approach it. This Pokémon will try to lick you with its tongue and steal your life away.
It fears the light and revels in the dark. It may be on the verge of extinction in cities that stay brightly lit at night.
On moonless nights, Haunter searches for someone to curse, so it’s best not to go out walking around.
