Litwick shines a light that absorbs the life energy of people and Pokémon, which becomes the fuel that it burns.
While shining a light and pretending to be a guide, it leeches off the life force of any who follow it.
Its flame is usually out, but it starts shining when it absorbs life force from people or Pokémon.
