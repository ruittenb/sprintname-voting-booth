A poor walker, it often falls down. However, its strong pride makes it puff up its chest without a care.
It doesn’t like to be taken care of. It’s difficult to bond with since it won’t listen to its Trainer.
Because it is very proud, it hates accepting food from people. Its thick down guards it from cold.
