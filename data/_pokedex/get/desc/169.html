The transformation of its legs into wings made it better at flying, but more clumsy at walking.
Having four wings allows it to fly more quickly and quietly so it can sneak up on prey without its noticing.
It flies so silently through the dark on its four wings that it may not be noticed even when nearby.
If this Pokémon is flying by fluttering only a pair of wings on either the forelegs or hind legs, it’s proof that Crobat has been flying a long distance. It switches the wings it uses if it is tired.
Crobat sneaks up on its intended prey using wings that barely make a sound. This Pokémon rests by hanging on a tree branch with its rear legs that serve as wings.
Silent and swift in its four-winged flight, it bites down on its prey before they realize what’s happening. In a heartbeat, it drains their blood.
Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark and sucks your blood, you won’t notice any pain or realize you’ve been bitten.
