In the rocky mountains where Charmeleon live, their fiery tails shine at night like stars.
It lashes about with its tail to knock down its foe. It then tears up the fallen opponent with sharp claws.
When it swings its burning tail, it elevates the air temperature to unbearably high levels.
Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.
