A Pokémon that startles people in the middle of the night. It gathers fear as its energy.
It gets nourishment from fear that it absorbs into its red orbs. In daytime, it sleeps in darkness.
It likes playing mischievous tricks, such as screaming and wailing to startle people at night.
Misdreavus frightens people with a creepy, sobbing cry. The Pokémon apparently uses its red spheres to absorb the fearful feelings of foes and turn them into nutrition.
If you hear a sobbing sound emanating from a vacant room, it’s undoubtedly a bit of mischief from Misdreavus.
What gives meaning to its life is surprising others. If you set your ear against the red orbs around its neck, you can hear shrieking.
