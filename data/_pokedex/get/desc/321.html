The biggest of all Pokémon. It can dive to a depth of almost 10,000 feet on only one breath.
It can sometimes knock out opponents with the shock created by breaching and crashing its big body onto the water.
Wailord is the largest of all identified Pokémon up to now. This giant Pokémon swims languorously in the vast open sea, eating massive amounts of food at once with its enormous mouth.
When chasing prey, Wailord herds them by leaping out of the water and making a humongous splash. It is breathtaking to see this Pokémon leaping out of the sea with others in its pod.
Its immense size is the reason for its popularity. Wailord watching is a favorite sightseeing activity in various parts of the world.
They eat so many fish Pokémon that when Wailord become too numerous, fishermen have to chase them off.
