It grows angry if you see its eyes and gets angrier if you run. If you beat it, it gets even madder.
It stops being angry only when nobody else is around. To view this moment is very difficult.
It is always outrageously furious. If it gives chase, it will tenaciously track the target no matter how far.
When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time.
Some researchers theorize that Primeape remains angry even when inside a Poké Ball.
It will never forgive opponents who have angered it. Even after it has beaten them down until they can’t move, it never ever forgives.
