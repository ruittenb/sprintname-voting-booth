It fights by keeping its shell tightly shut for protection and by shooting spikes to repel foes.
Cloyster that live in seas with harsh tidal currents grow large, sharp spikes on their shells.
Its shell is extremely hard. It cannot be shattered, even with a bomb. The shell opens only when it is attacking.
Cloyster is capable of swimming in the sea. It does so by swallowing water, then jetting it out toward the rear. This Pokémon shoots spikes from its shell using the same system.
Excavation of the tombs of ancient hunting tribes has turned up many spears tipped with spikes that had fallen off this Pokémon’s shell.
If areas of Cloyster’s very hard shell get damaged, those areas swell, gradually growing into large sharp spikes.
