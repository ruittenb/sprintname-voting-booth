It lives at the bottom of the sea. In the springtime, its pink body turns more vivid for some reason.
Its swimming form is exquisitely elegant. With its thin mouth, it feeds on seaweed that grows between rocks.
Gorebyss lives in the southern seas at extreme depths. Its body is built to withstand the enormous pressure of water at incredible depths. Because of this, this Pokémon’s body is unharmed by ordinary attacks.
Although Gorebyss is the very picture of elegance and beauty while swimming, it is also cruel. When it spots prey, this Pokémon inserts its thin mouth into the prey’s body and drains the prey of its body fluids.
The color of its body changes with the water temperature. The coloration of Gorebyss in Alola is almost blindingly vivid.
