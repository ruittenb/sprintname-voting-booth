Elekid stores electricity in its body. If it touches metal and accidentally discharges all its built-up electricity, this Pokémon begins swinging its arms in circles to recharge itself.
This Pokémon is constantly fighting with Togedemaru that try to steal its electricity. It’s a pretty even match.
When it hears the crash of thunder, Elekid’s mood improves. It can be useful to record that sound and play it when Elekid’s feeling down.
