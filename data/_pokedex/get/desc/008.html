It is said to live 10,000 years. Its furry tail is popular as a symbol of longevity.
When tapped, this Pokémon will pull in its head, but its tail will still stick out a little bit.
Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon’s toughness as a battler.
