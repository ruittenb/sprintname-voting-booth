Lanturn’s light can shine up from great depths. It is nicknamed “The Deep-Sea Star.”
It blinds prey with an intense burst of light. With the prey incapacitated, the Pokémon swallows it in a single gulp.
Lanturn is nicknamed “the deep-sea star” for its illuminated antenna. This Pokémon produces light by causing a chemical reaction between bacteria and its bodily fluids inside the antenna.
Lanturn is known to emit light. If you peer down into the dark sea from a ship at night, you can sometimes see this Pokémon’s light rising from the depths where it swims. It gives the sea an appearance of a starlit night.
This Pokémon flashes a bright light that blinds its prey. This creates an opening for it to deliver an electrical attack.
When the bacteria living inside its antennae absorb Lanturn’s bodily fluids, a strong luminescent effect is produced.
