They live buried in the sands of the desert. The sun-warmed sands prevent their body temperature from dropping.
It moves along below the sand’s surface, except for its nose and eyes. A dark membrane shields its eyes from the sun.
They live hidden under hot desert sands in order to keep their body temperature from dropping.
It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down on the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over it. Its favorite food is Trapinch.
Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pokémon. Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts.
