A Pokémon with a loyal nature. It will remain motionless until it is given an order by its Trainer.
Extremely loyal to its Trainer, it will bark at those who approach the Trainer unexpectedly and run them out of town.
Very friendly and faithful to people. It will try to repel enemies by barking and biting.
It has a brave and trustworthy nature. It fearlessly stands up to bigger and stronger foes.
Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything, this Pokémon won’t forget the scent, no matter what. It uses its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of other living things.
It looks cute, but when you approach another Trainer’s Growlithe, it will bark at you and bite.
While it’s quite friendly toward humans once it’s grown used to them, in the wild it must be quite fierce to defend its territory from Rockruff.
