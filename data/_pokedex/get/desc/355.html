It loves the crying of children. It startles bad kids by passing through walls and making them cry.
It doggedly pursues its prey wherever it goes. However, the chase is abandoned at sunrise.
If it finds bad children who won’t listen to their parents, it will spirit them away--or so it’s said.
Duskull can pass through any wall no matter how thick it may be. Once this Pokémon chooses a target, it will doggedly pursue the intended victim until the break of dawn.
Duskull wanders lost among the deep darkness of midnight. There is an oft-told admonishment given to misbehaving children that this Pokémon will spirit away bad children who earn scoldings from their mothers.
