It is said that Charizard’s fire burns hotter if it has experienced harsh battles.
When expelling a blast of superhot fire, the red flame at the tip of its tail burns more intensely.
Its wings can carry this Pokémon close to an altitude of 4,600 feet. It blows out fire at very high temperatures.
Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.
