The electric sacs in its cheeks are small. If even a little electricity leaks, it becomes shocked.
It plays with others by touching tails and setting off sparks. This appears to be a test of courage.
It is not yet skilled at storing electricity. It may send out a jolt if amused or startled.
Pichu charges itself with electricity more easily on days with thunderclouds or when the air is very dry. You can hear the crackling of static electricity coming off this Pokémon.
When Pichu plays with others, it may short out electricity with another Pichu, creating a shower of sparks. In that event, this Pokémon will begin crying, startled by the flash of sparks.
Despite this Pokémon’s cute appearance, those who want to live with one should prepare to be on the receiving end of its electric jolts.
It still can’t use electricity well. When it’s surprised or excited, it discharges electricity unintentionally.
