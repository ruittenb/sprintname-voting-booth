Being bitten by Shellder gave it intelligence comparable to that of award-winning scientists.
It has incredible intellect and intuition. Whatever the situation, it remains calm and collected.
When its head was bitten, toxins entered Slowpoke’s head and unlocked an extraordinary power.
Slowking undertakes research every day in an effort to solve the mysteries of the world. However, this Pokémon apparently forgets everything it has learned if the Shellder on its head comes off.
This Pokémon is so famed for its intellect that a proverb still persists in some regions: “When in doubt, ask Slowking.”
It’s constantly coming up with new ideas that would change the world, but as soon as it hits upon a new idea, it forgets it.
