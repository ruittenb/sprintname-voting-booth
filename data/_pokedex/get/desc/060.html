Its skin is so thin, its internal organs are visible. It has trouble walking on its newly grown feet.
Its slick black skin is thin and damp. A part of its internal organs can be seen through the skin as a spiral pattern.
The direction of the spiral on the belly differs by area. It is more adept at swimming than walking.
Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the Pokémon’s spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it.
It’s still not very good at walking. Its Trainers should train this Pokémon to walk every day.
Despite the danger, it wants to come up on land. So it does its best to waddle along, but when an enemy finds it, it rushes back to the water.
