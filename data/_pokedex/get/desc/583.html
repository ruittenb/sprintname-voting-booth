Snowy mountains are this Pokémon’s habitat. During an ancient ice age, they moved to southern areas.
It conceals itself from enemy eyes by creating many small ice particles and hiding among them.
They cool down the surrounding air and create ice particles, which they use to freeze their foes.
This Pokémon has existed since the Ice Age. It controls particles of ice, freezes its opponents, and then shatters them with a headbutt.
It sprays its enemies with grains of ice to freeze them. Most Vanillish in Alola are smaller than average.
