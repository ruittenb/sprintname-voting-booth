It is said that happiness will come to those who see a gathering of Clefairy dancing under a full moon.
On nights with a full moon, Clefairy gather from all over and dance. Bathing in moonlight makes them float.
The moonlight that it stores in the wings on its back apparently gives it the ability to float in midair.
On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep nestled up against each other.
On nights with a full moon, they gather together and dance. The surrounding area is enveloped in an abnormal magnetic field.
They’re popular, but they’re rare. Trainers who show them off recklessly may be targeted by thieves.
