A kindly Pokémon that lays highly nutritious eggs and shares them with injured Pokémon or people.
It is said to deliver happiness. Being compassionate, it shares its eggs with injured people.
It lays several eggs a day. The eggs are apparently rich in nutrients and extremely delicious.
Chansey lays nutritionally excellent eggs on an everyday basis. The eggs are so delicious, they are easily and eagerly devoured by even those people who have lost their appetite.
Not only are these Pokémon fast runners, they’re also few in number, so anyone who finds one must be lucky indeed.
It seems that other Pokémon’s efforts to take its delicious, nutritious egg away from it caused Chansey to get faster at fleeing.
