Its arms are made of plants that bind themselves to things. They grow back right away if cut.
Even if one of its arms is eaten, it’s fine. The Pokémon regenerates quickly and will go right back to normal.
It ensnares prey by extending arms made of vines. Losing arms to predators does not trouble it.
Its vines grow so profusely that, in the warm season, you can’t even see its eyes.
