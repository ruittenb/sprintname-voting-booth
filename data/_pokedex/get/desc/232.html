It has sharp, hard tusks and a rugged hide. Its Tackle is strong enough to knock down a house.
The longer and bigger its tusks, the higher its rank in its herd. The tusks take long to grow.
Donphan’s favorite attack is curling its body into a ball, then charging at its foe while rolling at high speed. Once it starts rolling, this Pokémon can’t stop very easily.
If Donphan were to tackle with its hard body, even a house could be destroyed. Using its massive strength, the Pokémon helps clear rock and mud slides that block mountain trails.
