A Magikarp living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.
It is virtually worthless in terms of both power and speed. It is the most weak and pathetic Pokémon in the world.
In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak descendants that exist today.
Magikarp is a pathetic excuse for a Pokémon that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This behavior prompted scientists to undertake research into it.
Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However, it is actually a very hardy Pokémon that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it is.
Its reckless leaps make it easy pickings for predators. On the bright side, many Pokémon enjoy longer life spans, thanks to Magikarp.
In the distant past, they were fairly strong, but they have become gradually weaker over time.
