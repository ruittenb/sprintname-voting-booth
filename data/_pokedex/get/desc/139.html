It is thought that this Pokémon became extinct because its spiral shell grew too large.
Its tentacles are highly developed as if they are hands and feet. As soon as it ensnares prey, it bites.
Once wrapped around its prey, it never lets go. It eats the prey by tearing at it with sharp fangs.
Omastar uses its tentacles to capture its prey. It is believed to have become extinct because its shell grew too large and heavy, causing its movements to become too slow and ponderous.
Its heavy shell is thought to be the reason this ancient Pokémon died out. It’s apparently a distant ancestor of Octillery.
