A Pokémon that lives underground. Because of its dark habitat, it is repelled by bright sunlight.
Lives about one yard underground where it feeds on plant roots. It sometimes appears aboveground.
Its skin is very thin. If it is exposed to light, its blood heats up, causing it to grow weak.
Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple— wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing delicious vegetables.
Many farmers cherish and nurture Diglett because its droppings enrich the soil it lives in.
It travels through tunnels that it digs underground. It hates sunlight, so it comes out only after the sun goes down.
