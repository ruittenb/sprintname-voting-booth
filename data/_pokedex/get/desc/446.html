In its desperation to gulp down food, it forgets about the food it has hidden under its fur.
It hides food under its long body hair. However, it forgets it has hidden the food.
It conceals food under the long fur on its body. It carts around this food stash and swallows it without chewing.
When it finds something that looks like it might be edible, it goes right ahead and swallows it whole. Thatâ€™s why it gets fatter day by day.
It hides food under its long fur, but it sometimes forgets about it and causes a stinky disturbance.
