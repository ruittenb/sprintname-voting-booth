It lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason.
It’s unsafe to approach if it gets violently enraged for no reason and can’t distinguish friends from foes.
When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it’s a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However, because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly, it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.
Its raging tires it out and causes it to fall asleep, but the anger resonating in its dreams causes it to wake up—which infuriates it all over again.
The smallest of things could cause it to lose its temper. Because it doesn’t hold in its stress, this Pokémon can live a long time.
