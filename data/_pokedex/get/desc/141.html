It is thought that this Pokémon came onto land because its prey adapted to life on land.
In the water, it tucks in its limbs to become more compact, then it wiggles its shell to swim fast.
A slim and fast swimmer. It slices its prey with its sharp sickles and drinks the body fluids.
Kabutops swam underwater to hunt for its prey in ancient times. The Pokémon was apparently evolving from being a water dweller to living on land as evident from the beginnings of change in its gills and legs.
Its body had begun to change so it could function on land. But it didn’t adapt in time and went extinct.
