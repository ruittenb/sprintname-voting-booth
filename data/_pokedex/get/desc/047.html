A mushroom grown larger than the hostâ€™s body controls Parasect. It scatters poisonous spores.
The larger the mushroom on its back grows, the stronger the mushroom spores it scatters.
Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.
It scatters toxic spores from its mushroom cap. Once harvested, these spores can be steeped and boiled down to prepare herbal medicines.
The bug is mostly dead, with the mushroom on its back having become the main body. If the mushroom comes off, the bug stops moving.
