Blades comprise this Pokémon’s entire body. If battling dulls the blades, it sharpens them on stones by the river.
They fight at Bisharp’s command. They cling to their prey and inflict damage by sinking their blades into it.
Ignoring their injuries, groups attack by sinking the blades that cover their bodies into their prey.
After shredding its prey, it sharpens its blades on a stone by the river. Each Pawniard has its own favorite sharpening stone.
