The leer that floats in darkness belongs to a Gengar delighting in casting curses on people.
It hides in shadows. It is said that if Gengar is hiding, it cools the area by nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
Hiding in peopleâ€™s shadows at night, it absorbs their heat. The chill it causes makes the victims shake.
Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow thrown by a streetlight will suddenly and startlingly overtake you. It is actually a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow.
It apparently wishes for a traveling companion. Since it was once human itself, it tries to create one by taking the lives of other humans.
You can hear tales told all over the world about how Gengar will pay a visit to children who are naughty.
