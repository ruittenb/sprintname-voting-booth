It has a mischievous spirit. If it spots an angler, it will tug on the fishing line to interfere.
It lives at the water’s edge where it is sunny. It sleeps on a bed of water-grass by day and becomes active at night.
Lombre is nocturnal—it will get active after dusk. It is also a mischief maker. When this Pokémon spots anglers, it tugs on their fishing lines from beneath the surface and enjoys their consternation.
Lombre’s entire body is covered by a slippery, slimy film. It feels horribly unpleasant to be touched by this Pokémon’s hands. Lombre is often mistaken for a human child.
