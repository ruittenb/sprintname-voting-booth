Wanting more garbage, they follow people who litter. They always belch poison gas.
It gorges on trash until its stomach is full. Then it belches toxic gas. An unlucky whiff of gas will put a person in the hospital.
Poisonous gas leaks out of it when it breathes. Muk that catch a whiff of that stench will come drooling.
