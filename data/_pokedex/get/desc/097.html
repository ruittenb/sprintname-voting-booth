Seeing its swinging pendulum can induce sleep in three seconds, even in someone who just woke up.
It carries a pendulum-like device. There once was an incident in which it took away a child it hypnotized.
Hypno holds a pendulum in its hand. The arcing movement and glitter of the pendulum lull the foe into a deep state of hypnosis. While this Pokémon searches for prey, it polishes the pendulum.
As a matter of course, it makes anyone it meets fall asleep and has a taste of their dreams. Anyone having a good dream, it carries off.
In Alola, Komala is Hypno’s main target. It rarely harms people.
