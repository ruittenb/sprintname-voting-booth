It scans its surroundings by raising its ears out of the grass. Its toxic horn is for protection.
Its large ears are flapped like wings when it is listening to distant sounds. It extends toxic barbs when angered.
Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice.
