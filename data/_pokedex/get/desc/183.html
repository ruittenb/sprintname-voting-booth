The oil-filled end of its tail floats on water. It keeps Marill from drowning even in a strong current.
The oil-filled tail functions as a buoy, so it’s fine even in rivers with strong currents.
The fur on its body naturally repels water. It can stay dry, even when it plays in the water.
The tip of its tail is filled with oil that is lighter than water, so it acts as a float.
Marill’s oil-filled tail acts much like a life preserver. If you see just its tail bobbing on the water’s surface, it’s a sure indication that this Pokémon is diving beneath the water to feed on aquatic plants.
When fishing for food at the edge of a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around the trunk of a tree. This Pokémon’s tail is flexible and configured to stretch.
