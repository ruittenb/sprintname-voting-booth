It transforms the kindness and joy of others into happiness, which it stores in its shell.
The shell seems to be filled with joy. It is said that it will share good luck when treated kindly.
A proverb claims that happiness will come to anyone who can make a sleeping Togepi stand up.
As its energy, Togepi uses the positive emotions of compassion and pleasure exuded by people and Pokémon. This Pokémon stores up feelings of happiness inside its shell, then shares them with others.
