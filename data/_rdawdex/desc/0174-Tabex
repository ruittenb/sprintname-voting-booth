 This Pok√©mon pretends to be an ancient artifact in order to lure grave robbers; once they pick it up, the markings on its body glow and the person is cursed forever. The markings are different on each one; it is said that the markings are actually words that can release an evil spirit unto the world if it is read correctly.
