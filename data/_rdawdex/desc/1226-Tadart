When embedded into trees, they are often mistaken as fruits by bird Pok√©mon. They have two defense mechanisms to protect themselves: they produce a  slimy, bitter film that makes them inedible, and they produce electricity in their bodies thanks to a small organ. They were once used as darts during old wars thanks to their ability to paralyze and poison at the same time. They could take down a Crinovor in mere seconds.
