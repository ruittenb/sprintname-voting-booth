Imported from another region, Comiwi spend majority of their time drinking nectar from different flowers. Their tail feathers look similar to one of their favorite flowers to drink from, so they often end up trying to drink from each other's tails. Due to their vivid colors, they are unable to blend into the environment, making them easy to find and capture.
