They spend most of their times playfully wrestling each other in tree tops.  They love to snack on leaves that grow from special trees.  The Eukawala in Cotue are much more aggressive, picking fights with any other Pokemon that crosses their path.  They are mostly nocturnal, raiding the dens of sleeping Pokemon for food.
