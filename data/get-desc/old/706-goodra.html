This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving that Trainer covered in sticky slime.
It attacks with retractable horns. It throws a punch that’s the equivalent of the force of a hundred pro boxers.
This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving that Trainer covered in sticky slime.
It attacks with retractable horns. It throws a punch that’s the equivalent of the force of a hundred pro boxers.
It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then, whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail.
It’s very friendly toward people. If you grow close to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky, slime-covered body. Don’t get mad.
